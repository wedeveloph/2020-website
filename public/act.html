It was established at the height of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo regime's political repression. However, the systematic violent, repressive and deceitful state continue to condone various forms of human rights abuses. The culture of impunity remains unabated. For this, Hustisya remains as an organization of victims, and relatives of the victims of human rights violations under any repressive government.

                      <p>Brooklyn Community Bail Fund secures the freedom of New Yorkers who would otherwise be detained pretrial due to their poverty alone. We are committed to challenging the criminalization of race, poverty and immigration status, the practice of putting a price on fundamental rights, and the persistent myth that bail is a necessary element of the justice system.</p>

                      <p>A coalition to demand that Minneapolis divest from policing and invest in long-term alternatives.</p>
                    <details>
                      <p>Reclaim the Block began in 2018 and organizes Minneapolis community and city council members to move money from the police department into other areas of the city’s budget that truly promote community health and safety. We believe health, safety and resiliency exist without police of any kind. We organize around policies that strengthen community-led safety initiatives and reduce reliance on police departments. We do not believe that increased regulation of or public engagement with the police will lead to safer communities, as community testimony and documented police conduct suggest otherwise.</p>

                  <p>Developh is exploring ways to tell the stories and amplify the lives and work of political activists and prisoners in the Philippines. We are a nation that has stigmatized their organizing work, despite it being the backbone of our countless rights and liberties. If you are a student and would like to join us in writing, curating, and designing ways to effectively and impactfully communicate this, please reach out to us. hello@developh.org</p>

                  <p>Developh is a Philippine-based, student-run organization working towards bridging the innovation gap. In the past year, we were thankfully able to get a good amount of financial support for our programming and are able to redirect some funds from our organization and our leaders' personal earnings to these pressing, urgent, global causes that comprise our initial $500.<br> If you are a tech organization that would like to coordinate and explore how we can best work towards collective action, we would love to talk with you. hello@developh.org</p>
