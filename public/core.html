We are not merely technologists or programmers. We are creators, writers, artists, designers, citizens, advocates. If we were only composed of programmers, our work would be meaningless.

                  <p>No need for resumes, we don't have stressful recruitment periods once a year, etc. Those are exclusionary. Here's an overview of our process. <em>If youâ€™re less confident in calls/chats or like on paper-presenting more, weâ€™re also happy to just exchange emails with you throughout the process! (We feel the same.) Also, at any time, feel free to email us if you have questions or concerns.</em></p>
                  
            <div class="process">
                  <h3>1.) Reach out to us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Express interest anytime! <a href="mailto:hello@developh.org" style="color: lightpink">Email is best</a>, or you can message any core members and weâ€™ll connect with you from there</li>
                <li>Establish why you are interested in Developh, share with us some context about yourself so we can get a sense of your background and interests</li>
            </ul>
                  
            <h3>2.) Informational Interview: ~30 minute introduction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We share how the core team works and get a sense of what programs/projects (existing or otherwise) you might be interested in</li>
                <li>We learn more about you and how Developh can contribute to <em>your growth.</em></li>
            </ul>
                  
            <h3>3.) Interview: ~45 minutes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This is an opportunity for us to learn more about your ability and drive to get involved in a project! We'll dive deeper into your proposals, ideas, and thought processes in the areas of the org you're interested in</li>
                <li>We want to learn more about your skills, how you approach different situations, leadership abilities, and work style</li>
                <li>(Donâ€™t worry about weird hypothetical questions, we hate those and don't do them. This is still pretty casual, just more on your experiences and what it would be like to work with you in a team.)</li>
            </ul>
        
                  <h3>4.) Deliberation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The core team is introduced to the prospective applicant.</li>
                <li>This is an opportunity for the entire team to know about how the prospective core member can be integrated into projects. Is there an existing member that can onboard them? Is there an opportunity area someone can point out?</li>
            </ul>
                  
                   <h3>5.) Onboarding!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If all goes well, we'll do an individual onboarding with you to get you set up on all platforms, on our projects, and look over what you can start adding value to :)</li>
                <li>If interested, we'll get you set up with coffee chats with other members, core swag/merch, and set up our next hangout/game night to ease you in!</li>

                  <h1>Expectations for<br>the Core Team</h1>
                  
                  
                  <p><u>Take ownership.</u> We don't give assignments. As a core member, youâ€™re someone who is proactive; either claim tasks we list at [our task file] yourself (or with another orgmate), start your own initiative, or take action!</p>
 
                  <p><u>Communicate actively!</u> We use Slack and email, and we hope core members are able to adjust to these platforms to be productive. This isn't about responding right away. Weâ€™re located all over the world, communicate asynchronously, and pick up after one naother. This does mean backreading, @ing people or messaging for context!<br>You are always welcome to approach any executive member individually (or any other member!) to help you catch up and be briefed on something.<br>
Communicating actively means being transparent about how long it will take you to finish something, letting us know if something is up, and communicating your worries and not just your wins.</p>
                  
             <p><u>Love impact, not vanity.</u> We put in the good work. No work is busywork. Many impactful things are not visible and we recognize that.</p>
                  
              <p><u>Your growth is our growth.</u> Weâ€™re not a new organization anymore, and have resources to help you succeed not only in the context of projects you get involved in at Developh, but career-wise and academically also. <br>We provide the opportunities you'd expect: from workshops, networking, courses, help on career-building, etc. and encourage you to take these on<br>When we do check-ins, something we frequently discuss around is what are your goals, and how can we help you achieve them? We want to help you individually too!</p>
                
            <p><u>On hours.</u> Although thereâ€™s no set hour requirements, we anticipate core members devoting 1â€“3 hours per week into Developh at minimum. This will change depending on the programs/projects you own.<br>Feel free to take breaks! Donâ€™t apologize if life/academics are coming at you! You have so many other priorities ahead of you: Develop will always be here.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Thank you to the Developh core team who helped put this document together.</p>
