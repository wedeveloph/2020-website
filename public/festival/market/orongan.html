        <p>Nikko Orongan- I'm a high school student, and an artist that practices on portrait paintings, my main medium in creating such artworks is oil paints. I'm a self-taught artist that has experience in terms of making commissions. I love doing portrait paintings because it gives me that satisfaction of turning a blob of paint into something fascinating. I started painting when I was a kid, and as I grow up, m seeing dramatic improvements in the way I portray my pieces. That's why I took painting seriously, and doing paintings is also a way for me to ease out and relax. I also practice on other mediums such as watercolor and graphite portraits when I have free time! Feel free to check my art-related account! instagram.com/nikk.artss<br>

Hannah Labadan- Hi! I'm Hannah Faith Labadan, a self-taught, and an aspiring artist. I am new to digital art, but I've been making art since I was 14, and I do a commission. My main medium is digital, and I use watercolors too. Right now, my subject matter that I mainly focus on are portraits of girls. Still, I make illustrations with mushroom themes as well. I love experimenting with colors, trying out different art styles, and other techniques. I also love redrawing studio ghibli's screencaps!!

Christy Sevilla- Konnichiwa~! The Name's Christy Sevilla. I would also call myself A Self-taught Artist, just like the others. I had found the Creativity of mine since the age of 7 and is Improving little by little as the day goes by. I Construct my art with the help of Digital Devices. My Main Contents focuses on Half bodies in any gender, but Mostly I do Male Illustrations. I construct my art for fun and Release it around social media for people to see How I had been Improving since Day 1. Currently Practicing on Realism arts, But for now, I'm sticking with Anime Style.

Carlo Ochavillo- Hi, my name's Carlos. I would say I'm self-taught as well since I have never considered taking classes. Whenever I see a paper and a pen, it is in my instinct to immediately doodle some things that are on my mind. I have an interest in comic book styles and sculpting with clay. Although I am more familiar with clay, and I am confident that I have the capabilities that have to do with a pen or anything related to making something with paper. I have been practicing on other comic book styles. Now I don't want to call myself an artist just yet. I have more to learn but believing in the philosophy of "cogito ergo sum," I believe I am.
